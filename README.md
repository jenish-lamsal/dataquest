# Data Science Projects in Python
This repository consists of python scripts that I have written for practice
while learning python for data science from [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/).
I have used the pandas, numpy and the matplotlib library to analyze and
visualize data.

## Projects:
[Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/python_for_data_science_practice/blob/master/Exploring%20Ebay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)<br/>
Pandas and numpy library were used to explore and clean the raw data.</br>
[Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/dataquest/blob/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20on%20College%20Majors.ipynb)<br/>
Matplotlib library was used to visualize Earnings Based on College Majors Pandas
answer some key questions.</br>
[Visualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/dataquest/blob/master/Visualizing%20the%20Gender%20Gap%20in%20College%20Degrees.ipynb)<br/>
Matplotlib library was used to visualize the gender gap across college degrees.
