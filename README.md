# Data Science Projects
This repository consists of python scripts and SQL queries that I have written for practice
while learning python for data science from [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/).

## Projects
### Python Projects:
#### I have used the pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib library to analyze and visualize data.
1. [Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/python_for_data_science_practice/blob/master/Exploring%20Ebay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)<br/>
Pandas and numpy library were used to explore and clean the raw data.</br>

2. [Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/dataquest/blob/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20on%20College%20Majors.ipynb)<br/>
Matplotlib library was used to visualize Earnings Based on College Majors Pandas
answer some key questions.</br>

3. [Visualizing the Gender Gap in College Degrees](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/dataquest/blob/master/Visualizing%20the%20Gender%20Gap%20in%20College%20Degrees.ipynb)<br/>
Matplotlib library was used to visualize the gender gap across college degrees.

### SQL Projects:
1. [Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL](https://github.com/jenish-lamsal/dataquest/blob/master/Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQL.ipynb)<br/>
SQLite database was used to analyze data from the CIA world Factbook
